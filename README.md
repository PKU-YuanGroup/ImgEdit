# üåç Introduction
**ImgEdit** is a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks.

To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality.

Using ImgEdit, we train **ImgEdit-E1**, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design.

For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce **ImgEdit-Bench**, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation.
It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite.
We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1.

# üî• News
- [2025.07.27] We update our leaderboard [here](#jump), add ICEdit, BAGEL, OmniGen2, Flux-Kontext-dev and Ovis-U1 on ImgEditBench.

# üí° ImgEdit Dataset
## üì£ Overview
### Data statistic
![image](assets/pie.png)

### Single Turn tasks and Multi-Turn tasks
We comprehensively categorize single-turn image editing tasks into 10 tasks and multi-turn image editing tasks into 3 tasks.

# üñ•Ô∏è  ImgEdit Pipeline 
![image](assets/datapipeline.png)
1. Data Preparation & Filter (using Laion-aes dataset, only retain samples with aesthetic score greater than 4.75, then use Qwen2.5VL-7B to generate dense caption and use GPT-4o to generate short caption.)
2. Generate bounding box and segamentation mask (using [Yolo-world](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World) and [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2)) and filter with CLIP.
3. Generate diverse edit prompts using GPT-4o
4. Task-based editing pipelines using ComfyUI
5. Data Quality Filter using GPT-4o
We provide dataset after segamentation, since it maybe a good dataset to train other models(VLMs)

**ImgEdit Dataset Format**

The final ImgEdit dataset are in parquet format, the input and output images can be found in .tar files.
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("parquet", data_files="./remove_part5.parquet")
print(ds['train'][0])
# {'input_images': ['results_remove_laion_part5/00094_00030_000304748/original.png'], 'output_images': ['results_remove_laion_part5/00094_00030_000304748/result.png'], 'prompt': 'Remove the group of people snowshoeing in winter clothing located in the far-right upper-middle of the image.'}
```

For multi-turn dataset:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("parquet", data_files="./version_backtracking_part0.parquet")
print(ds['train'][0])
# {'data': [{'input_images': ['results_version_backtracking_part0/00031_00020_000209651/origin_0.png'], 'output_images': ['results_version_backtracking_part0/00031_00020_000209651/result_0.png'], 'prompt': 'add a green vest in the middle-right area of the image, covering a torso sized approximately from mid-waist to chest'}, {'input_images': ['results_version_backtracking_part0/00031_00020_000209651/origin_1.png'], 'output_images': ['results_version_backtracking_part0/00031_00020_000209651/result_1.png'], 'prompt': 'replace the green vest with a brown leather jacket'}, {'input_images': ['results_version_backtracking_part0/00031_00020_000209651/origin_2.png'], 'output_images': ['results_version_backtracking_part0/00031_00020_000209651/result_2.png'], 'prompt': 'withdraw the previous round of modifications, adjust the green vest in round1 to have a brighter shade of green and a subtle quilted texture'}]}

## üõ†Ô∏è Setups for ImgEdit pipeline

WIP


# üéñÔ∏è ImgEdit-Bench
**ImgEdit-Bench** consists of three key components: a basic editing suite that evaluates instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation across a diverse
range of tasks; an Understanding-Grounding-Editing (UGE) suite, which increases task complexity
through challenging instructions (e.g., spatial reasoning and multi-object targets) and complex scenes
such as multi-instance layouts or camouflaged objects; and a multi-turn editing suite, designed to
assess content understanding, content memory, and version backtracking.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Setups for ImgEdit-Judge

1. You should setup your environment following [Qwen2.5-VL](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL)
2. Download the ImgEdit_Judge checkpoint from huggingface.
3. We give a demo code as follow, you should change the prompt with the corresponding tasks in [prompts.json](Benchmark/Basic/prompts.json) to get the best performance. 
```python
import torch
from transformers import Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info
prompt = ""
# Load the processor

# Load the model with recommended configurations
model = Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    # "/mnt/workspace/yangye/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
    "ImgEdit_Judge/checkpoint/path",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
    device_map="auto",
    local_files_only=True,
)
min_pixels = 1016064  # we train our model with this settings
max_pixels = 1354752  # we train our model with this settings
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("ImgEdit_Judge/checkpoint/path", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels)  

messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": prompt.replace("<edit_prompt>", edit_prompt)},
                {"type": "image", "image": original_path},
                {"type": "image", "image": result_path},
            ],
        }
    ]

    # Prepare for inference
    text = processor.apply_chat_template(
        messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
    )
    image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)
    inputs = processor(
        text=[text],
        images=image_inputs,
        videos=video_inputs,
        padding=True,
        return_tensors="pt",
    )
    inputs = inputs.to(model.device)

    # Inference: Generation of the output
    generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=2048)
    generated_ids_trimmed = [
        out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
    ]
    output_text = processor.batch_decode(
        generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
    )
```
